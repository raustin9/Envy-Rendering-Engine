# Envy Rendering Engine

## Current Effects:
1. Normal Mapping: on the planet in the background
2. Gausian Blur: On the sun (it is hard to tell on the sun, so you can render your own object to see it better)
3. Environment Mapping: Cube map \[still in progress]

## Usage
This is an API that is used to create complex graphical scenes with much more ease than using WebGL itself.  
By looking at the example, you can see that it is easy to lead .obj 3D models, and you can apply textures and movements to them.  
You can also write your own shaders or use the ones that I have provided **They are still in progress**

## My Own Notes:
I want to say that this was an incredibly fun project that I will definitely continue to build on in the future.
Even though some of the effects are pretty cool, and I got some cool models to render, I would say that the coolest part of this project is the code design for sure.
I spent a lot of time designing the API for this, and it paid off in spades. It is now incredibly easy to make your own objects and shaders with this API.
I am going to spend some time writing some documentation, so that it might actually become a useful library for me in the future.
Overall, this was a ton of fun, and I had a blast creating this.
It has been an awesome class.

## NOTES FOR FUTURE:
* Create own file and class for textures to clean up their creation
* Add documentation for all methods and describe use cases for them
* ADD FRAMEBUFFER

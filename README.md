# FINAL PROJECT FOR CS 452

## For this final, we needed to have at least 3 objects rendered and at least 3 'effects'
## Objects:
1. Planet
2. The fighters
3. USS Enterprise
4. Sun

## Effects:
1. Normal Mapping: on the planet in the background
2. Gausian Blur: On the sun (it is hard to tell on the sun, so you can render your own object to see it better)
3. Environment Mapping: On the "crystals" in the background

## My Own Notes:
I want to say that this was an incredibly fun project that I will definitely continue to build on in the future.
Even though some of the effects are pretty cool, and I got some cool models to render, I would say that the coolest part of this project is the code design for sure.
I spent a lot of time designing the API for this, and it paid off in spades. It is now incredibly easy to make your own objects and shaders with this API.
I am going to spend some time writing some documentation, so that it might actually become a useful library for me in the future.
Overall, this was a ton of fun, and I had a blast creating this.
It has been an awesome class.

## NOTES FOR FUTURE:
* Create own file and class for textures to clean up their creation
* Add documentation for all methods and describe use cases for them
* ADD FRAMEBUFFER
